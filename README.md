# Babbelaar - Language Learning Through Conversations

Babbelaar is a language learning app that helps you learn a foreign language through personalized conversations with an AI teacher. By default, it uses a free LLM service courteously provided by [LLM7.io](https://llm7.io/), but you can also configure it to use OpenAI's ChatGPT with your own API key.

This app runs completely in your browser, with no server-side componentâ€”your data stays local and only conversation messages are sent to the configured AI service.

## Requirements

- **No setup required**: Works out of the box with the free LLM service provided by [LLM7.io](https://llm7.io/)
- **Optional**: OpenAI API key for ChatGPT (get one at https://platform.openai.com/)
- Alternative LLM providers are also supported, as long as they support the Chat Completions API.

## How It Works

1. **First Visit**: You'll be prompted to create a profile
2. **Conversations**: The AI teacher starts conversations based on your interests and level
3. **Word Learning**: Important conversational words like greetings, basic phrases, and topic-specific vocabulary are introduced
4. **Corrections**: When you make mistakes, the teacher provides corrections and explanations
5. **Progress**: All conversations are saved in your browser's local storage

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no external libraries)
- **Default AI**: Free LLM service provided by [LLM7.io](https://llm7.io/)
- **Optional AI**: OpenAI Chat Completions API and other compatible providers
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage for profile and conversation history

## Privacy

- All data is stored locally in your browser
- Your API key (if used) is stored locally and never sent to our servers
- Only your conversations are sent to the configured AI service (LLM7.io by default, or OpenAI if configured)
- Future versions will support exporting data to cloud storage services

## Future Enhancements

- Text-to-speech (TTS) for pronunciation
- Speech recognition for voice input
- Export/import profile and conversation data
- Cloud storage integration (OneDrive, Dropbox)
- More advanced language learning features

## Troubleshooting

**Can't send messages?**
- Try the default LLM7.io service first (no API key required)
- If using OpenAI, check your API key
- Ensure you have internet connection
- If using OpenAI, verify your API key has sufficient credits

**Translations not working?**
- Make sure the conversation has started
- Only teacher messages have clickable words
- Try refreshing the page if issues persist

**Profile not saving?**
- Ensure all required fields are filled
- Check if your browser allows localStorage
- Try clearing browser cache and starting over
